## Test Command Updates
- `test:e2e:current`: Now includes OpenAPI integration tests and workflow sharing tests
- `test:e2e:p0`: OpenAPI tests removed (now part of current stable suite)

## Remaining Issues
- **Test Pass Rate Decline**: 262 tests failing (down from previous 100% pass rate)
  - **Primary Issue**: Prisma validation errors in test cleanup (`undefined` values in arrays)
  - **Secondary Issue**: UI element timing issues in various test suites
- **UX Compliance Timeout**: Multiple OAuth2 tests failing due to UX compliance validation timeout
- **P0.1.1 MVP Blocker**: Multi-step workflow generation not yet implemented (TDD tests created, implementation pending)
