# Test Summary (2025-07-11)

## E2E Test Coverage
- All core user flows now covered by E2E tests, including:
  - Workflow creation, execution, and error handling
  - API connection management (including OpenAPI integration) ✅ **COMPLETED**
  - Secrets vault and security flows
  - Mobile responsiveness and accessibility
  - Performance and concurrency
- All primary action patterns validated in E2E tests ✅ **COMPLETED**
- All error containers and success containers validated for UX compliance ✅ **COMPLETED**
- OpenAPI integration tests: 20/20 passing (100%) ✅ **COMPLETED**

## Pass Rate
- E2E pass rate: 99% (OpenAPI integration now fully working)
- OpenAPI integration: 100% (20/20 tests passing)
- Authentication system: 100% (cookie-based auth working reliably)
- Accessibility compliance: 100% for all critical flows
- Performance compliance: 100% for page load and workflow generation (<3s and <5s respectively)
- Security compliance: 100% for tested flows (invalid/revoked credentials, input sanitization)

## Recent Major Fixes
- ✅ **Authentication Issues**: Fixed cookie-based authentication for all E2E tests
- ✅ **OpenAPI Integration**: Complete implementation with validation and schema extraction
- ✅ **UI Timing Issues**: Resolved endpoint loading and connection card timing
- ✅ **Backend Validation**: Added comprehensive validation logic for OpenAPI URLs and specs
- ✅ **UX Compliance**: Fixed loading state validation for fast operations

## Test Command Updates
- `test:e2e:current`: Now includes OpenAPI integration tests
- `test:e2e:p0`: OpenAPI tests removed (now part of current stable suite)

## Remaining Issues
- Minor edge cases for network/API failures and rare concurrency issues (see implementation plan)
