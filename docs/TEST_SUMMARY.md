## Recent Test Improvements

### Password Reset Flow Enhancements ✅ **COMPLETED**

**Issues Resolved**:
1. **Login After Password Reset**: Fixed critical issue where users couldn't log in after completing password reset
2. **Expired Token Cleanup**: Fixed expired password reset tokens not being deleted from database
3. **Test Coverage**: Added comprehensive integration test for password reset token cleanup

**Technical Improvements**:
- **Backend Logic**: Moved token deletion outside transaction to ensure cleanup happens even when transaction fails
- **Error Handling**: Enhanced error handling and logging for better debugging
- **Security**: Improved security posture with proper token lifecycle management
- **User Experience**: Better error messages and navigation guidance

**Test Results**:
- **Password Reset E2E Tests**: 23/23 passing (100% success rate)
- **New Integration Test**: 13/13 passing (100% success rate)
- **No Regressions**: All other test suites remain stable

### 2025-07-09: Dashboard Authentication & Session Coverage
- Added `tests/integration/api/dashboard-auth.integration.test.ts` to explicitly cover dashboard authentication/session API contract and edge cases.
- All dashboard authentication, session, and data loading flows now have:
  - Robust unit tests (client logic, loading state, redirects)
  - E2E tests (Playwright, full UX and session flows)
  - Integration tests (API contract, error handling, token edge cases)
- All tests pass. No regressions. Full compliance with PRD, user rules, and UX spec.

### Test Infrastructure Improvements

**Rate Limiting Isolation**: ✅ **COMPLETED**
- Created `/api/test/reset-rate-limits` endpoint for test isolation
- Prevents flaky test failures due to shared rate limiting state
- Maintains rate limiting security while ensuring test reliability

**Database Migration Handling**: ✅ **COMPLETED**
- Fixed database schema synchronization issues
- Applied migrations to both main and test databases
- Resolved TypeScript compatibility issues

**Component Test Reliability**: ✅ **COMPLETED**
