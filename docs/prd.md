## Executive Summary

### Product Overview
APIQ is a semi-agentic, low-code web application that enables users to orchestrate complex workflows across multiple APIs using natural language and AI-powered automation. The platform transforms how developers and non-technical users interact with multiple APIs by providing an intuitive, conversational interface for workflow creation and execution.

### Problem Statement
