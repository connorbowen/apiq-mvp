# APIQ MVP Implementation Plan

## Project Overview

APIQ MVP is a Next.js-based API integration platform that enables users to connect, manage, and orchestrate external APIs through a unified interface. The platform provides AI-powered workflow automation, real-time monitoring, and comprehensive audit logging.

**Core Vision**: "Democratize API orchestration by making complex multi-API workflows accessible to everyone through natural language and AI."

**Key Innovation**: Users can describe workflows in natural language (e.g., "When a new GitHub issue is created, send a Slack notification and create a Trello card"), and the system automatically generates and executes the corresponding multi-step workflow across multiple APIs.

### **P0.1.1: Multi-Step Workflow Generation** 🚨 **CRITICAL PRIORITY - MVP BLOCKER**
**Current Issue**: System only generates single-step workflows, severely limiting the core value proposition.

**Debug Evidence**: 
- Current workflow generation creates only one step per request
- No support for multi-step orchestration (e.g., "webhook → transform → action")
- Missing data flow between steps
- This is a fundamental limitation that prevents the system from delivering its core value proposition

**Implementation Plan**:
- [ ] **Workflow Planning Engine** - Break complex requests into multiple steps
  - [ ] Implement workflow decomposition logic
  - [ ] Add step dependency analysis
  - [ ] Support common patterns (webhook → action, data sync, etc.)
  - [ ] Add step ordering and sequencing
- [ ] **Data Flow Mapping** - Connect outputs to inputs across steps
  - [ ] Add data mapping UI for step-to-step connections
  - [ ] Support JSON path and template transformations

- Data flows correctly between workflow steps
- Users can understand and modify multi-step workflows
- Workflow execution handles step dependencies correctly

### **P0.1.2: Function Name Collision Prevention** 🚨 **HIGH PRIORITY**
**Current Issue**: Function names can conflict when APIs have similar endpoint patterns.

**Debug Evidence**:
- Function names like `Slack_post__repos__owner___repo` are confusing
- No API prefix to distinguish between different APIs
- Potential for name collisions with similar endpoint patterns

**Implementation Plan**:
