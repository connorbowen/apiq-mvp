# APIQ MVP Implementation Plan

## Project Overview

APIQ MVP is a Next.js-based API integration platform that enables users to connect, manage, and orchestrate external APIs through a unified interface. The platform provides AI-powered workflow automation, real-time monitoring, and comprehensive audit logging.

**Core Vision**: "Democratize API orchestration by making complex multi-API workflows accessible to everyone through natural language and AI."

**Key Innovation**: Users can describe workflows in natural language (e.g., "When a new GitHub issue is created, send a Slack notification and create a Trello card"), and the system automatically generates and executes the corresponding multi-step workflow across multiple APIs.

## Current Status: MVP Core Engine In Progress 🚧

**Test Status**: 330+ tests, 100% pass rate
**Last Updated**: January 2025
**Next Milestone**: MVP Core Engine - Natural Language Workflow Creation

**E2E Test Status**: 
- Auth e2e tests: ✅ 9/9 passing
- Connections e2e tests: 🚧 25/25 failing (debugging in progress)
- UI e2e tests: ✅ Passing
- Workflow e2e tests: ✅ Passing
