# APIQ MVP Implementation Plan

## Project Overview

APIQ MVP is a Next.js-based API integration platform that enables users to connect, manage, and orchestrate external APIs through a unified interface. The platform provides AI-powered workflow automation, real-time monitoring, and comprehensive audit logging.

**Core Vision**: "Democratize API orchestration by making complex multi-API workflows accessible to everyone through natural language and AI."

**Key Innovation**: Users can describe workflows in natural language (e.g., "When a new GitHub issue is created, send a Slack notification and create a Trello card"), and the system automatically generates and executes the corresponding multi-step workflow across multiple APIs.

### **P0.1.1: Multi-Step Workflow Generation** ðŸš¨ **HIGH PRIORITY**
**Current Issue**: System only generates single-step workflows, limiting complex automation scenarios.

**Debug Evidence**: 
- Current workflow generation creates only one step per request
- No support for multi-step orchestration (e.g., "webhook â†’ transform â†’ action")
- Missing data flow between steps

**Implementation Plan**:
- [ ] **Workflow Planning Engine** - Break complex requests into multiple steps
  - [ ] Implement workflow decomposition logic
