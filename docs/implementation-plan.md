# APIQ MVP Implementation Plan

## Project Overview

APIQ MVP is a Next.js-based API integration platform that enables users to connect, manage, and orchestrate external APIs through a unified interface. The platform provides AI-powered workflow automation, real-time monitoring, and comprehensive audit logging.

**Core Vision**: "Democratize API orchestration by making complex multi-API workflows accessible to everyone through natural language and AI."

**Key Innovation**: Users can describe workflows in natural language (e.g., "When a new GitHub issue is created, send a Slack notification and create a Trello card"), and the system automatically generates and executes the corresponding multi-step workflow across multiple APIs.

## Current Status: MVP Core Engine Partially Complete ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Test Status**: All tests passing (100% pass rate) ‚úÖ **MAINTAINED**
**Unit Test Coverage**: 656/657 passing (99.8% success rate) ‚úÖ **IMPROVED**

## **CRITICAL IMPROVEMENTS BASED ON DEBUG ANALYSIS** üö®

Based on the detailed analysis of the natural language workflow generation system and debug output, the following critical improvements are needed to enhance the core value proposition:

### **P0.1.1: Multi-Step Workflow Generation** üö® **CRITICAL PRIORITY - MVP BLOCKER**
**Current Issue**: System only generates single-step workflows, severely limiting the core value proposition.

**Debug Evidence**: 
- Current workflow generation creates only one step per request
- No support for multi-step orchestration (e.g., "webhook ‚Üí transform ‚Üí action")
- Missing data flow between steps
- This is a fundamental limitation that prevents the system from delivering its core value proposition

**Implementation Plan**:
- [ ] **Workflow Planning Engine** - Break complex requests into multiple steps
  - [ ] Implement workflow decomposition logic
  - [ ] Add step dependency analysis
  - [ ] Support common patterns (webhook ‚Üí action, data sync, etc.)
  - [ ] Add step ordering and sequencing
- [ ] **Data Flow Mapping** - Connect outputs to inputs across steps
  - [ ] Add data mapping UI for step-to-step connections
  - [ ] Support JSON path and template transformations
  - [ ] Add data validation between steps
  - [ ] Support conditional data flow based on step results
- [ ] **Enhanced System Prompt** - Better guidance for multi-step generation
  - [ ] Update prompt to encourage multi-step workflows

- Data flows correctly between workflow steps
- Users can understand and modify multi-step workflows
- Workflow execution handles step dependencies correctly

### **P0.1.2: Function Name Collision Prevention** üö® **HIGH PRIORITY**
**Current Issue**: Function names can conflict when APIs have similar endpoint patterns.

**Debug Evidence**:
- Function names like `Slack_post__repos__owner___repo` are confusing
- No API prefix to distinguish between different APIs
- Potential for name collisions with similar endpoint patterns

**Implementation Plan**:
- [ ] **API-Prefixed Function Names** - Clear API identification
  - [ ] Add API name prefix to all function names (e.g., "GitHub_", "Slack_")
  - [ ] Implement function name uniqueness validation

**Success Criteria**:
- All function names include API prefix
- No function name collisions in the system
- Function names are clear and descriptive
- OpenAI can distinguish between similar endpoints from different APIs

### **P0.1.3: Parameter Schema Enhancement** üö® **MEDIUM PRIORITY**
**Current Issue**: Parameter schemas are too generic, limiting workflow generation quality.

### **P0.1.4: Context-Aware Function Filtering** üö® **MEDIUM PRIORITY**
**Current Issue**: All functions are sent to OpenAI, potentially hitting token limits and reducing relevance.

**Debug Evidence**:
- All available functions sent to OpenAI regardless of relevance
- No filtering based on user request context
- Potential for token overflow with many APIs

  - [ ] Generate TypeScript interfaces from inferred schemas
  - [ ] Support nested object and array detection
  - [ ] Add data type inference (string, number, boolean, date, etc.)
  - [ ] Implement schema validation and refinement

- [ ] **Authentication Method Detection** - Automatically detect and configure auth methods
  - [ ] Detect API key requirements from headers or query parameters
  - [ ] Identify OAuth2 endpoints from common patterns
