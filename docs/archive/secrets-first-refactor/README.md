# Secrets-First Refactor Archive

This directory contains the implementation documentation for the **Secrets-First Refactor** that was completed on **2024-07-16**.

## What Was Accomplished

The secrets-first refactor successfully consolidated all credential storage into the secrets vault, eliminating duplication between the `ApiCredential` table and the secrets system. This improved security, user experience, and maintainability.

## Documents

- **`SECRETS_FIRST_REFACTOR_PLAN.md`** - Comprehensive implementation plan with all 9 phases
- **`SECRETS_FIRST_REFACTOR_TODOS.md`** - Implementation summary and completion status

## Why Archived

These documents are archived because:
- âœ… **Implementation Complete**: All phases successfully completed
- âœ… **Tests Passing**: All secrets-first functionality working correctly
- âœ… **Production Ready**: Refactor is live and stable
- ðŸ“š **Historical Reference**: Preserved for future developers and maintenance

## Current Status

The secrets-first approach is now the **default behavior** for all API connections in the application. All new connections automatically create and manage secrets through the secrets vault.

## Related Files
