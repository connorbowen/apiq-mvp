# Secrets-First Refactor Implementation Plan

> **Checklist updated as of 2024-07-16. All phases completed and tested successfully.**

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive plan to implement a secrets-first approach for API connections in the APIQ MVP. The goal is to eliminate credential duplication and provide a unified, secure approach to managing API credentials through the secrets vault.

## Current State Analysis

### Problem
- **Duplication**: Credentials are stored in two places - both in connections and in the secrets vault
- **Confusion**: Users don't know whether to manage credentials in connections or secrets
- **Inconsistency**: Different credential management patterns across the application
- **Security Risk**: Credentials stored directly in connection objects

### Solution
- **Secrets-First**: All credentials stored exclusively in the secrets vault
- **Connection References**: Connections reference secrets instead of storing credentials directly
- **Unified Management**: Single source of truth for all credential management
- **Enhanced Security**: Leverage existing secrets vault encryption and rotation
