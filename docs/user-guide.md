# APIQ User Guide

Welcome to APIQ! This guide will help you get started with creating powerful workflows that connect your favorite apps and services using natural language and AI-powered automation.

## Getting Started

- Complete email verification (you'll be automatically signed in after verification)
- Set up your first API connection

### 2. Connect Your Apps
- Go to the "Connections" page in your dashboard
- Choose from our supported integrations (GitHub, Slack, Trello, etc.)
- Follow the OAuth2 flow to securely connect your accounts
- Your credentials are encrypted and stored securely

## Creating Workflows

### Natural Language Workflow Creation (Recommended) ðŸ†•

The easiest way to create workflows is using natural language! Simply describe what you want to happen in plain English, and our AI will create the workflow for you.

#### How It Works:
1. **Go to "Create Workflow"** - Click the "Create Workflow" button in your dashboard
2. **Describe Your Workflow** - Tell us what you want to happen, for example:
   - "When a new GitHub issue is created, send a Slack notification"
   - "When a Trello card is moved to 'Done', create a Google Calendar event"
   - "When a new email arrives in Gmail, create a task in Todoist"
   - "Every Monday at 9 AM, check our Google Analytics and send a summary to Slack"
3. **Review & Confirm** - We'll generate a workflow and show you exactly what will happen
4. **Customize if Needed** - Modify any steps or add conditions before saving
5. **Save & Activate** - Your workflow is ready to run!

#### Example Workflows:
```
"When someone creates a new GitHub issue with the label 'bug', 
send a message to the #bugs Slack channel with the issue details"
```

```
"When a new customer signs up through our website form, 
add them to our Mailchimp list and create a welcome email"
```

```
"Every Monday at 9 AM, check our Google Analytics for the previous week 
and send a summary report to our team Slack channel"
```

#### Advanced Features:
- **Alternative Suggestions** - If we can't create exactly what you want, we'll suggest alternatives
- **Workflow Validation** - We'll check your workflow for potential issues and suggest improvements
- **Context Awareness** - The AI remembers your previous requests and can build on them
- **Confidence Scoring** - We'll tell you how confident we are in the generated workflow

### Manual Workflow Builder

For more complex workflows or fine-grained control, you can use our visual workflow builder:

1. **Add Triggers** - Choose what starts your workflow (webhook, schedule, manual)
2. **Add Actions** - Select what actions to perform (send email, create task, etc.)
3. **Configure Steps** - Set up the data mapping between steps
4. **Add Conditions** - Use if/then logic to create dynamic workflows
5. **Test & Deploy** - Test your workflow and activate it

## Managing Your Workflows

### Dashboard Overview
- **Active Workflows** - See all your running workflows
- **Recent Executions** - Monitor recent workflow runs
- **Performance Metrics** - Track success rates and execution times
- **Quick Actions** - Create new workflows, add connections, or manage secrets

### Workflow Management
- **Pause/Resume** - Temporarily stop workflows without losing data
- **Edit Workflows** - Modify existing workflows at any time
- **Execution History** - View detailed logs of all workflow runs
- **Error Handling** - See failed executions and retry options
- **Real-time Monitoring** - Watch workflows execute in real-time

## Managing Secrets ðŸ†•

The Secrets Vault provides secure storage for your API keys, OAuth2 tokens, and other sensitive data.

### Adding Secrets
1. **Go to Secrets Tab** - Access the secrets management section in your dashboard
2. **Create New Secret** - Click "Create Secret" and choose the type:
   - **API Key** - For API authentication
   - **OAuth2 Token** - For OAuth2 connections
   - **Webhook Secret** - For webhook security
   - **Custom Secret** - For any other sensitive data
3. **Configure Settings** - Set expiration dates and rotation intervals
4. **Save Securely** - Your secret is encrypted and stored safely

### Secret Management Features
- **Automatic Rotation** - Set up automatic secret rotation for enhanced security
- **Version History** - Track all versions of your secrets
- **Expiration Management** - Set expiration dates for temporary secrets
- **Secure Access** - Secrets are never logged or exposed in error messages

## Advanced Features

### Data Transformations
- **Field Mapping** - Map data between different apps
- **Data Filtering** - Filter data based on conditions
- **Data Enrichment** - Add calculated fields or external data

### Conditional Logic
- **If/Then/Else** - Create dynamic workflows based on data
- **Multiple Conditions** - Combine multiple conditions with AND/OR logic
- **Nested Conditions** - Create complex decision trees

### Scheduling & Timing
- **Cron Expressions** - Schedule workflows to run at specific times
- **Relative Timing** - Run workflows relative to events
- **Time Zones** - Configure workflows for different time zones

### Execution Control ðŸ†•
- **Pause/Resume** - Pause running workflows and resume them later
- **Cancel Execution** - Stop workflows that are currently running
- **Real-time Progress** - Monitor workflow execution step by step
- **Execution Logs** - View detailed logs for debugging and monitoring

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Connection Errors** - Re-authenticate your API connections
2. **Data Mapping Issues** - Check field names and data types
3. **Rate Limiting** - Some APIs have rate limits; we handle retries automatically
4. **Secret Expiration** - Check if your API keys or tokens have expired
